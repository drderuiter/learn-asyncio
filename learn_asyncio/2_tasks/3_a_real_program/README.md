# Tasks - A real program

Well, relatively real. We create three tasks, that take a variable amount of time, await them, and inspect their results.

Also note the handy `asyncio` methods for finding all Tasks, and the one that currently runs. Hint: one of the Tasks we find is the the one that wraps `main()`.
